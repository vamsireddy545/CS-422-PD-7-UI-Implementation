# Grading

We would like to be graded based on how our design would look like on a typical computer monitor.

# Changes

We made the "Leave a Review" button on the pages showing more detailed information about a food item bigger as according to user feedback.

# How to Start

To start interacting with the front end, simply unzip the zipped file and open the Welcome.html file in your browser. Everything else that is part of our front end is accessible from that page.
