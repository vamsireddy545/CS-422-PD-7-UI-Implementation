To start interacting with the front end, simply unzip the zipped file and open the Welcome.html file in your browser. Everything else that is part of our front end is accessible from that page.  

# Contributions

I worked on the Welcome, Log In, Account page, and associated CSS + JS, the Cart, Check Out, Thank You Page, and associated CSS + JS, "Food" HTML pages (the ones showing four different options in each category), so TrendingFood, TrendingBeverages, VeganFood, VegetarianFood, HalalFood, FoodFromSmallBusinesses, SearchResults, and associated CSS + JS, Food Item and Review Page, and associated CSS + JS.
